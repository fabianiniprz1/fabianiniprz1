<h1> Hello, I am Fabianini Prz 😎 </h1>

###  <h2> Who am I? 👨‍💼 🌱 ⚡ 🚴‍</h2>

I am a Business intelligence analyst with over 4 years of experience developing queries to extract information from databases, making presentations, and building solutions to solve issues.

I enjoy so much to get knowledge about everything such as cooking, drawing, Science, etc... but my favorite branch is data.

In my "free time" I love to travel at mountains on bike or feet, I enjoy workout at parks, and I like so much swimming, but I don't do this very well.

###  <h2> My favorites tools 🛠 </h2>

- SQL Server
- Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Excel
- Data Studio
- Power BI
- Visual Studio (SSIS)
- GIT

###  <h2> What do I want? ✨</h2>

I would like to help people to learn about technology, I will do that by sharing my projects and explaining what and how I have done.
